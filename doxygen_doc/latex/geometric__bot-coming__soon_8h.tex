struct \hyperlink{structvcn__mshqmix__s}{vcn\+\_\+mshqmix\+\_\+s}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em Read-\/only mesh structure conformed by triangles and quadrilaterals. Such a mesh is produced by joining couples of triangles which maximizes the quality of the quadrilateral formed, using a greedy strategy. \end{DoxyCompactList}\item

\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em Read-\/only structure storing a mesh of quadrilaterals, which is the result of a perfect matching of couples of triangles maximizing the global quality of quadrilaterals, without leaving isolated triangles in the mesh. \end{DoxyCompactList}\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
