VCN Bots
========

Validated Numerical Computations.
---------------------------------
A numerical bot is an automatic tool to perform related numerical task.
For example, the Geometric Bot calculates Delaunay triangulations, Finite Element Meshes,
Voronoi diagrams, etc. and the Eigen Bot is a linear algebra library, which includes
special routines for sparse systems.
VCN Bots is an ecosystem of numerical bots.

Compilation
----------
1. Create a 'build' directory inside this directory.
2. Go to the 'build' directory and execute the following command:
        cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ../
   (You must have cmake installed)
3. Execute 'make'.
