       eessppeeaakk is a software speech synthesizer for English, and some other languages.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       --hh     Show summary of options.

       ----vveerrssiioonn
              Prints the espeak library version and the location of the espeak voice data.

       --ff <<tteexxtt ffiillee>>
              Text file to speak

       ----ssttddiinn
              Read text input from stdin instead of a file

       If neither -f nor --stdin, <words> are spoken, or if none then text is spoken from stdin, each line separately.

       --qq     Quiet, don't produce any speech (may be useful with -x)

       --aa <<iinntteeggeerr>>
              Amplitude, 0 to 20, default is 10

       --ll <<iinntteeggeerr>>
              Line length. If not zero (which is the default), consider lines less than this length as and-of-clause

       --pp <<iinntteeggeerr>>
              Pitch adjustment, 0 to 99, default is 50

       --ss <<iinntteeggeerr>>
              Speed in words per minute, default is 160

       --vv <<vvooiiccee nnaammee>>
              Use voice file of this name from espeak-data/voices

       --bb     Input text encoding, 1=UTF8, 2=8 bit, 4=16 bit

       --bb     Input text encoding, 1=UTF8, 2=8 bit, 4=16 bit

       --mm     Indicates that the text contains SSML (Speech Synthesis Markup Language) tags or other XML tags. Those SSML tags which are supported are interpreted.
              Other tags, including HTML, are ignored, except that some HTML tags such as <hr> <h2> and <li> ensure a break in the speech.

       --ww <<wwaavvee ffiillee nnaammee>>
              Write output to this WAV file, rather than speaking it directly

       --xx     Write phoneme mnemonics to stdout

       --XX     Write phonemes mnemonics and translation trace to stdout. If rules files have been built with --compile=debug, line numbers will also be displayed.

       ----ssttddoouutt
              Write speech output to stdout

       ----iippaa  Write phonemes to stdout using International Phonetic Alphabet. --ipa=1 Use ties, --ipa=2 Use ZWJ, --ipa=3 Separate with _

       ----ppaatthh==<<ppaatthh>>
              Specifies the directory containing the espeak-data directory

       ----pphhoo  Write mbrola phoneme data (.pho) to stdout or to the file in --phonout

       ----pphhoonnoouutt==<<ffiilleennaammee>>
              Write output from -x -X commands and mbrola phoneme data to this file

       ----ppuunncctt==""<<cchhaarraacctteerrss>>""
              Speak the names of punctuation characters during speaking. If =<characters> is omitted, all punctuation is spoken.

       --kk <<iinntteeggeerr>>
              Indicate capital letters with: 1=sound, 2=the word "capitals", higher values = a pitch increase (try -k20).

       ----vvooiicceess[[==<<llaanngguuaaggee ccooddee>>]]
              Lists the available voices. If =<language code> is present then only those voices which are suitable for that language are listed.

       ----vvooiicceess==<<ddiirreeccttoorryy>>
              lists the voices in the specified subdirectory.

       ----ccoommppiillee==vvooiicceennaammee
              Compile the pronunciation rules and dictionary in the current directory. =<voice name> is optional and specifies which language

       ----ccoommppiillee==ddeebbuugg
              Compile the pronunciation rules and dictionary in the current directory as above, but include line numbers, that get shown when -X is used.
